# Glioblastoma-Tumor-Microenvironment---Perinecrotic-Niche-Analysis
R and Python scripts were used to perform bioinformatics data analysis of eight glioblastoma (GBM) tumor Xenium high resolution spatial transcriptomics samples. A perinecrotic niche was identified in each sample. Differential effects of GBM treatment regimens on cell-cell communication in the perinecrotic niche were identified.
